## Overview
RF-counting reforms the overall DL framework for specialization in an RF-based crowd counting, in consideration of the domain knowledge of indoor radio signals. To ensure the deep neural networkâ€™s strength on automatic feature formation to become valid even for radio data and the final goal (i.e., use in a robust people counting system), we propose novel solutions from three principal aspects: 1) data preprocessing; 2) the design strategy for the network architecture; and 3) training of the deep network model. Several experimental results using real measured data show that the proposed scheme enables an effective utilization of deep learning framework for radio-based crowd counting, achieving a significant performance improvement compared to conventional methods.
