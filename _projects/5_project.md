## *Micro-Doppler for Human Physiology*

For effective construction of the calibrated EO-IR-SAR dataset. We developted a UAV-borne data acquisition system, which is capable of collecting temporally/spatially synchronized EO-IR images. In terms of SAR branch, we leveraged a cycle GAN framework to form corresponding fake-SAR images.

Based on the parallelized EfficientDet architecture, we comprehensively analyzed the detection/classification performance with respect to EO-IR-SAR fusion at each level, and designed an attention-based module to maximize the fusion gain.

We collected our own dataset in two different conditions, which we refer to as RRMstatic and RRM-moving for stationary and moving conditions respectively. The RRM-static and RRM-moving datasets consist of synchronized FMCW radar echoes (i.e., RF signals), RGB videos, and ground-truth respiration signals, each of which was collected in a situation where a person faces forward while sitting in a chair or freely walks around the interior room, respectively. For static cases, we placed a chair about 70 cm away from the radar and camera, and then requested each participant to look straight ahead while holding her/his breath intermittently. For moving cases, we obtained FMCW radar reflections in moving scenarios where each person was allowed to walk around freely except for irregular movements such as a person running or falling, within a space of about 4 m Ã— 5 m.
