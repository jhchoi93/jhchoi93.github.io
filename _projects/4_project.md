The complex nature of the RF signal allows it to measure not only the radial distance information for the targets of interest, but also the instantaneous changes in the radial distance (i.e., radial velocity) based on the Doppler characteristics. We devise a radio joint time-frequency map, which takes advantage of the Doppler characteristics of RF signals to entail the information of instantaneous distance changes in radial direction, thereby tracking the micro-vital movements around the chest area.

Caturing the micro-Doppler signatures near the neck, human voice according to vocal cord shaking can also be reconstructed from RF reflections.

We establish the theoretical foundation connecting the micro-Doppler signatures and motion dynamics of small UAVs based on the Doppler spectrum, and analyze their spectral distribution using simulations and measured data. In addition, comprehensive experimental analyses are conducted using the data measured from various types of small UAVs considering the translational motion and aspect change.
