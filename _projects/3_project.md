## *Through-the-Wall Detection*
<hr>
### Overview
<p align="center"><img src="https://jhchoi93.github.io/assets/img/RF-localization/Through-wall_result.png" width="500px"/></p>

RF sensors's radio property allows it to perceive the human targets throuh the occluded wall. To compensate for the low SNR components from the desired through-the-wall human reflections, we propose to leverage the scaled Fourier transform-based alignment and coherent signal integration.

## *Single-Sensor Location via AoA Estimation*
<hr>
### Overview
<p align="center"><img src="https://jhchoi93.github.io/assets/img/RF-localization/FMCW_result.png" width="1050px"/></p>

MIMO configuration can provide the angular infromation of its surrounding targets based on spatially distributed receivers. Estimating the radial signatures from time-of-arrival (ToA) as well as the angular ones from angle-of-arrival (AoA) schemes, we can achieve the illuminatio/occlusion-resistant 2D localization system.
