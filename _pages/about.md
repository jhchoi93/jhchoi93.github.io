I am a Ph.D Candidate at [POSTECH](https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/pohang-university-science-technology-postech) (Pohang University of Science and Technology), advised by Prof. Kyung-Tae Kim. I did my M.S. at POSTECH and B.S. at [Korea University](https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/korea-university). 

My research interests lie in **wireless sensing** and **machine learning**, for indoor human sensing and health monitoring. I am also interested in the **sensor fusion** and **multi-modal learning** algorithms.
